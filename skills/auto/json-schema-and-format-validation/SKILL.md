## JSON Output Validation Guide
1. **Metadata Blocks**: Ensure required metadata objects (e.g., `meta`) contain all mandated keys (`source`, `rows_in`, `rows_used`, etc.).
2. **Data Types**: 
   - Represent money values as integer cents (multiply floating-point amounts by 100 and cast to integers).
   - Ensure service names or identifiers follow requested formatting rules (e.g., lower-case with hyphens replaced by underscores).
3. **Top-Level Schema**: Verify top-level required keys (e.g., `schema_version`, `generated_by`) are present.
4. **Sorting**: Ensure array items are sorted by the required hierarchy (e.g., by service then by timestamp ascending).
